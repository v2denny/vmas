we read the paper

listed todo stuff

mpe vs vmas (DONE)
-remade outdated code
-added gpu
-modification part
-graphs blablabla

rllib (TODO: use other ppo based things)
-added stuff to original code
-modification part
-video rendering, etcc

benchmarl (TODO: clean script, use other ppos)
-used too
-modification part
-show graphs

results
-show videos
-replication was difficult because outdated code
-ran good on gpu
-we concluded same things as them
-we enhanced/remade/modifies some of their code
