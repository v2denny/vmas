1. we read the paper
2. listed todo stuff
3. replicated as well modified/enhanced/remade some code
4. run things
5. get results
6. got same conclusions

A. mpe vs vmas (DONE)
  - remade outdated code
  - added gpu
  - modification part
  - graphs blablabla

B. rllib (TODO: use other ppo based things)
  - added stuff to original code
  - modification part
  - video rendering, etcc

C. benchmarl (TODO: clean script, use other ppos)
  - used too
  - modification part
  - show graphs

D. results
  - show videos
  - replication was difficult because outdated code
  - ran good on gpu
  - we concluded same things as them
  - we enhanced/remade/modifies some of their code
